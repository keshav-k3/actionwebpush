## Code of Conduct

This project adheres to the [Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating, you are expected to uphold this code.

## Getting Started

1. Fork the repository on GitHub
2. Clone your fork locally
3. Set up the development environment
4. Create a feature branch for your changes

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Ruby 2.6.0 or higher
- Rails 6.0 or higher
- Redis (for rate limiting tests)
- Git

### Setup

```bash
# Clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/actionwebpush.git
cd actionwebpush

# Install dependencies
bundle install

# Run tests to ensure everything works
bundle exec rake test
```

### Development Dependencies

The gem uses these development tools:
- **Minitest** for testing
- **SQLite3** for test database
- **Resque** for background job testing
- **WebMock** for HTTP mocking in tests

## Making Changes

### Branch Naming

Use descriptive branch names:
- `feature/add-batch-delivery`
- `fix/rate-limiter-race-condition`
- `docs/update-readme`

### Code Style

- Follow Ruby community standards
- Use 2 spaces for indentation
- Keep lines under 120 characters
- Add comments for complex logic
- Use descriptive variable and method names

### Commit Messages

Write clear, descriptive commit messages:
```
Add batch delivery optimization for large subscription lists

- Implement batching logic in BatchDelivery class
- Add configuration option for batch size
- Include tests for batch processing
- Update documentation with batch delivery examples

Fixes #42
```

## Testing

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
bundle exec rake test

# Run specific test file
bundle exec ruby test/notification_test.rb

# Run tests with coverage
bundle exec rake test:coverage
```

### Test Structure

- **Unit tests**: Test individual classes and methods
- **Integration tests**: Test component interactions
- **System tests**: Test end-to-end functionality

### Writing Tests

- Write tests for new features
- Ensure edge cases are covered
- Mock external dependencies (WebPush API calls)
- Use descriptive test names

Example:
```ruby
def test_notification_delivery_with_expired_subscription
  # Test setup
  # Test execution
  # Assertions
end
```

### Test Requirements

- All new code must have tests
- Maintain or improve test coverage
- Tests must pass on Ruby 2.6+ and Rails 6.0+

## Submitting Changes

### Pull Request Process

1. **Update documentation** if your changes affect the public API
2. **Add tests** for new functionality
3. **Update CHANGELOG.md** with your changes
4. **Ensure all tests pass**
5. **Create a pull request** with:
   - Clear title and description
   - Reference to related issues
   - Screenshots/examples if applicable

3. Create git tag for version
4. Build and push gem to RubyGems
5. Create GitHub release with notes

## Development Guidelines

### Adding New Features

1. **Discuss first**: Open an issue to discuss major features
2. **Design consideration**: Consider impact on existing API
3. **Documentation**: Update README and API docs
4. **Tests**: Comprehensive test coverage required
5. **Examples**: Add usage examples

### Maintaining Backward Compatibility

- Avoid breaking changes in minor versions
- Deprecate features before removing them
- Provide migration paths for breaking changes
- Document any compatibility requirements
